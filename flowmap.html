    <h2>Flow Pattern Interpretation</h2>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to a saving error, the original flow map project file and exported image were lost. The placeholder above will be replaced by a final map before the next submission window.</p>

    <p><strong>Interpretation (to be expanded):</strong> This map originally visualized [insert flow type here â€” e.g., migration patterns, student origins]. General flow direction was [e.g., west-to-east], and the most prominent nodes included [City A and City B]. Flow volume was represented using proportional symbols and a choropleth base map provided additional geographic context.</p>
