    <p>Hi! Hello, I am Olivia Cunningham. I am currently a junior at the University of Iowa, pursuing a degree in Environmental Policy and Planning with a GIS certificate. My coursework covers ecological issues, environmental science, public health, sustainability, and urban planning, focusing on human impacts, conservation efforts, and the development of sustainable, livable cities in the U.S. Next spring, I will be studying a range of courses that complement my degree in Environmental Policy and Planning and my certificate in GIS. In Ecosystem Services, I will learn to use geographic techniques to measure, map, and model ecosystem services, while also exploring how human activities impact these services and inform policy. My coursework in Geographic Visualization will enhance my skills in cartographic representation, spatiotemporal visualization, and 3D modeling, all essential for effective environmental analysis. In LiDAR: Principles and Applications, I will gain expertise in using LiDAR technology for applications such as hydrology, flooding, and transportation planning. Additionally, through my Capstone Research with ICIGO, I will apply GIS skills in hands-on projects focused on sustainability, collaborating with teams and non-profits to create spatial analyses, visualizations, and web content. These experiences will shape my ability to integrate GIS with environmental policy and planning practices.</p>
