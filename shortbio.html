    <p><p>Hello! I’m Olivia Cunningham, a junior at the University of Iowa majoring in Environmental Policy and Planning with a certificate in Geographic Information Science (GIS). My coursework focuses on ecological systems, urban planning, sustainability, and how human activity impacts the environment. I’m currently enrolled in advanced courses on U.S. energy policy, LiDAR technology, and geographic visualization. Outside of academics, I live an active lifestyle and enjoy hiking, exercising, and spending time outdoors. I’m passionate about conservation and environmental education, and I’m exploring career paths that blend research, fieldwork, and public engagement.</p>
