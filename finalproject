    <h1>Final Project: Drought Vulnerability in California</h1>
    <p>This project explores drought vulnerability across California by visualizing a series of factors that contribute to risk and resilience. The maps below highlight environmental stress, water infrastructure, social vulnerability, and other geographic indicators.</p>

    <h2>Map 1: Drought-Prone Regions</h2>
