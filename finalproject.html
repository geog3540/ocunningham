          <h1>Beyond the Drought: Mapping California’s Water Resilience and Inequality</h1>
          <p>This project explores how prepared California’s regions are for future droughts, even as current drought conditions have subsided. Using interactive geovisualization tools, the project highlights historic precipitation trends, infrastructure gaps, and socio-economic inequities in access to water resilience. By reframing the narrative from “drought crisis” to “long-term water security,” this project aims to support planners, policymakers, and advocates in building a more equitable and climate-ready California.</p>

          <h2>Map 1: Average Precipitation (2020–2024)</h2>

          <p>This map displays the average annual precipitation across California counties from 2020 to 2024. It clearly shows that coastal and northern regions received significantly more rainfall than interior and southern counties. Some inland areas, especially in the Central Valley and Southern California, experienced notably low precipitation, reinforcing their vulnerability to drought. Meanwhile, parts of Northern California and the Sierra Nevada foothills appear to have higher rainfall, which may help buffer those areas against drought stress. This spatial pattern highlights the uneven distribution of water resources and sets the stage for understanding regional differences in drought vulnerability.</p>

          <h2>Map 2: Drought Severity and Socioeconomic Inequality</h2>

          <p><img src="images/finalbiv.png" alt="Bivariate Map of Drought and Income in California" width="600"></p>
          <p>This bivariate map displays the intersection of average drought severity (measured by the Palmer Drought Severity Index) and median household income at the county level for July 2021 — one of the driest months California has experienced in decades. The visualization highlights regions where both environmental and economic stress were at their peak, revealing areas that may struggle most with long-term water insecurity. By comparing physical drought risk with socioeconomic vulnerability, this map helps identify communities that face compounding challenges and are most in need of targeted, equitable water policy interventions.</p>

          <h2>Map 3: Failing Water Systems in California</h2>

  <p>This map visualizes the distribution of failing water systems across California using proportional symbols. Larger circles represent counties with more failing water systems, many of which are located in rural or lower-income areas. These regions often lack the financial resources and infrastructure to maintain safe, reliable access to drinking water. This map highlights how water system failures compound drought vulnerability and environmental injustice, especially in communities already facing structural disadvantage.</p>



          <p>Each map includes analysis of the relevant spatial patterns, contributing to a better understanding of drought-related risks and planning strategies in California.</p>
